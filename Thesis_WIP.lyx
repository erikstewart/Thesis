In modern, highly mechanized forest product production, one of the key routes

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conifers have a variety of defense systems for dealing with both biotic
 and abiotic threats.
 The major defense systems which conifers posses for dealing with pathogens
 are constitutive and inducible defenses.
 Structural, or constitutive defenses include tissues, structures, and chemicals
 present in parts of the tree which either prevent or reduce the possibility
 or severity of infection by a pathogen.
 Induced defenses are initiated locally and/or systemically upon the recognition
 of a pathogen, and include a variety of possible defense actions including
 secondary metabolite production, priming of system wide defenses, and changes
 to physical structures of the tree.
 Genetic defenses represent gene level interactions between plant and pathogen,
 and can confer increased resistance to a pathogen or outright immunity,
 depending on the tree and pathogen.
 The constitutive and induced systems of defense present in conifers are
 not mutually exclusive of one another, and interact with components of
 the other systems of defense within the tree on some level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Constitutive Defenses in Conifers 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constituent defenses present throughout conifers include various types of
 tissues and structures which are produced during regular, unchallenged
 growth.
 Bark represents the outermost layer of defense in a conifer, and is comprised
 of several distinct tissues: periderm, cortex, phloem and cambial tissues.
 The periderm is highly suberized and hydrophobic which helps to inhibit
 adhesion and germination of fungal spores
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Pearce1996"

.
 In most cases, it is not possible for a fungal pathogen to actively infiltrate
 intact outer bark tissues, a notable exception being some species of fungi
 in the family 
\emph on
Armillaria 
\emph default
which can penetrate outer defenses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\begin_layout Standard
Features present in the phloem tissues which allow the 
\emph on
P.
 abies
\emph default
 to resist damages and pathogen includes polyphenolic parenchyma cells,
 and lignified cells.
 Polyphenolic parenchyma (PP) cells are present throughout the trees phloem
 tissues, and store phenolic compounds which are released if the cells are
 damaged by wounding either from mechanical forces or via pathogen growth.
 The phenolic compounds have various anti microbial properties, and resistant
 clones of

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Franceschi1998"

\end_inset

.
 Xylem tissues include some similar defense mechanisms to cells in phloem
 tissues.
 Lignified cells within the xylem increase the mechanical strength of a
 tree, and are more resistant to fungal infections.
 However, much higher portions of parenchyma cells exist within the xylem
 in conifers, predominantly in the form of xylem rays.
 PP cells are also present in large numbers in the xylem tissues.
 Further barriers to damage from pathogens or mechanical forces include
 large amounts of lignified and suberized tissues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sapwood tissues have a variety of constituent and structural defenses, as
 well as the ability to induce defenses in response to a pathogen.
 For example, the sapwood tissues in Norway spruce which are more resistant
 to fungal infection have larger polyphenolic paranchyma cells, which can
 contribute to differences in resistance levels of the phloem in individual
 trees depending on the resistance of a given phenotype 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Nagy2004"

\end_inset

.
 Trees also create barriers in response to pathogens, compartmentalizing
 both axially and radially in response to damages or detection of a pathogen.
 Increases to lignification near affected tissues, plugging of vascular
 tissues, and programmed cell death are utilized by the tree to attempt
 to exclude the pathogen from vulnerable areas within the host.

In addition to the compartmentalization of tissues surrounding a wound or

 is also created, which is characterized by increased levels of lignin in
 surrounding tissues, increased production of phytoalexans, free radical

 Increases in accumulation of antimicrobial compounds in the reaction area
 help to restrict further progression of pathogens or damages which caused
 the response and compartmentalization of the area in the first place.
 The hypersensitive response is the activation of programmed cellular death

Overall, co-evolution is a important driving factor in the development of

 This type of novel interaction between susceptible host and introduced

 Random effects are the effects of grouping or clustering present in the

Hypotheses
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Hypothesis 1: Lesion sizes in the Rovaniemi field site will be larger.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Differences in growing site location, as well as differences in genetic
 makeup of the stands in the two sites differ, and it is presumed that these
 differences will have an effect on the characteristics of the lesions at
 the site level.
 Because it is believed that the area in Rovaniemi has been largely isolated
 from the pressures of the pathogen, it is assumed that this will decrease
 resistance response to the pathogen in comparison to trees at the Lapinjarvi
 site.
 This effect was tested by inoculations in a balanced design experiment
 across two field sites, and further analyzed by utilizing a mixed effects
 model to characterize the lesions in a hierarchical framework accounting
 for inherent nesting and lack of heteroscedasticity expected in data collected
 from the experiment.

 as well as taking into account the natural infection pathways of 
\emph on
H.

\emph default
it is presumed that a difference in the response will manifest as larger
 lesions within the roots because it is the natural infection pathway for
 which the pathogen is adapted.

 other explanatory variables.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Hypothesis 3: Lesions sizes in xylem tissues will be lower than those in
 phloem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Due to different anatomical features in xylem and phloem tissues, it is
 presumed the host will respond differently to the infection in different
 tissues.
 It is hypothesized that the xylem tissues present with smaller lesions
 due to the fact that high amounts of lignified tissues will present a greater
 challenge for the pathogen to overcome compared to softer living tissues
 within the phloem.
 This effect is tested with the mixed effect model, and further elaborated
 upon by examining interactions between the effect of tissue in conjunction
 with other explanatory variables.

DONE BRIEFLY : Describe the root diameters in Rovaniemi
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two sites were used in this study, one in northern Finland (Rovaniemi) where
 presence of 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum
\emph default
 was not known to occur naturally in Norway spruce stands, and a site in
 Southern Finland in Lapinjärvi, where extensive presence of the pathogen
 has been noted historically.
 In Rovaniemi, the site was comprised of planted trees with an age of around
 35 years, from natural, non clonal stock representative of the natural
 local populations of Norway Spruce.
 In Lapinjärvi, the site was comprised of naturally regenerated trees (non-plant
ed), with estimates of age ranging from 30-60 years old.
 Soils in the northern site were rockier, versus softer soils in the southern
 field site.
 Trees in Rovaniemi had visibly significantly smaller root systems than
 those in Lapinjärvi, although no measurements were taken.
 At each of the two field sites, a total of fifteen trees were selected
 for each treatment group; wounding control, and infection.
 Trees which were obviously damaged due to biotic or anthropogenic factors,
 or trees which were obviously extremely young, or otherwise unhealthy were
 excluded from selection.

\begin_layout Subsection
Inoculum Preparation 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The culture of 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum
\emph default
, isolate #03014 (Kari Korhonen) was used for this study.
 The isolated was obtained from a Norway spruce tree in Kuhmoinen, central
 Finland.
 The culture was maintained on 2% malt extract agar and kept at 4º Celsius.
 To create a delivery vessel for the inoculum, wooden dowels of Norway spruce
 measuring roughly 6 mm diameter by 7 mm length were created utilizing a
 drill press and a jewelers saw.
 Cut and formed dowels were autoclaved for thirty minutes with roughly 100
 milliliters of Milli-Q water.
 Subsequently, autoclaved dowels for control trees were placed onto previously
 prepared 2% malt extract agar plates, and incubated at room temperature
 for two weeks.
 Autoclaved dowels utilized for infection were placed onto 2% malt extract
 agar plates which were precolonized with the 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum
\emph default
 isolate, and were similarly incubated at room temperature for two weeks
 time.

\begin_layout Subsection
Preparation of Study Trees and Inoculation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inoculations in Lapinjärvi were carried out the 14th of June, 2013.
 In Rovaniemi, inoculations were carried out on the 26th of June, 2013.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this study, each tree was treated with a total of six inoculations;
 three stem inoculations placed at 50 cm, 100 cm, and 150 cm above the soil
 level, and three in the roots placed opportunistically depending on the
 size and shape of the exposed roots.
 Whenever possible the inoculations were placed on the parts of the root
 facing upwards towards the crown of the tree.
 A minimum of 25 cm upwards or downwards was maintained whenever possible
 between root inoculations in instances where a single large root was inoculated
 more than once.
 In all trees, the inoculations were performed such that the inoculation
 point of the stem inoculations was at the same direction to minimize any
 possible variance due to azimuth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to inoculations i.e, insertion of wounding (termed as control) dowels
 or 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum 
\emph default
colonized (termed as infection) dowels, roots of the study trees were dug
 up carefully using garden spades, and then outer surfaces of exposed roots
 were cleaned of excess dirt and debris utilizing a large brush with synthetic
 fiber hairs.
 Directly before inoculating the trees, the area where the inoculation were
 to be placed was sprayed with 70% ethanol to minimize the possibility of
 introducing localized contaminants into the xylem or phloem of the tree.
 All tools utilized in the inoculation process which had direct contact
 with either the host tree, or wooden inoculation dowels (and thus, potentially
 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum
\emph default
) were sprayed with 70% ethanol and wiped clean prior to each use.
 Tools used for inoculations included: stainless steel forceps, for handling
 of the wooden dowel and removing any excess original host tissues, a 7
 mm interior diameter stainless steel punch for creating the bore and removing
 host tissue, and a large rubber headed mallet, utilized for hammering in
 the punch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each stem inoculation, a steel punch with a diameter of 7 mm was used
 to bore through the bark of the tree to the inoculation point.
 Living host tissue from the cavity created by the bore was removed, and
 then inspected to ensure that the depth of the hole bored reached into
 the xylem of the host tree.
 Confirmation of sufficient depth was done by inspecting the tissue removed
 from the bore; a clear delineation exists between phloem and xylem tissues
 in 
\emph on
P.
 abies
\emph default
.
 Immediately after confirmation of adequate bore depth, a wooden dowel for
 the specific treatment for the tree was introduced into the hole and secured
 into host tissue via use of forceps and the back end of the bore.
 Immediately after the dowel was secured into the host tissues, the area
 of the inoculation was wrapped with parafilm to minimize the chance of
 post-inoculation contamination.
 After trees were inoculated and inoculation points were wrapped with parafilm,
 the roots were covered with the loose soil removed to expose the roots
 for inoculations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Harvest and Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
After three months, inoculated trees were cut down for procesing.
 Roots of the respective trees were re-dug carefully and extracted.
 Primary tools utilized in harvest were chainsaws.
 Only the lower segment of the stem containing the inoculation points were
 removed from the site for further processing (See fig X).
 In root samples, as much as was feasible and reasonable, was collected
 for each inoculation.
 Samples were labeled with the site (L, R, for Lapinjärvi or Rovaniemi respectiv
ely), treatment (W, for wounding control, T, for treatment), tree (1-15),
 and replicate number, (A, B, and C for stem representing 50, 100, and 150
 cm inoculation points, and R1, R2, R3 for root inoculations, with R1 being
 the closest inoculation point to the root collar) before storing.
 Additionally, the direction of growth (i.e., towards crown) was marked on
 stem segments.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All samples were placed into large black trash bags (Lapinjärvi) or Kevlar
 sacks (Rovaniemi) once trimmed to size at the respective field site.
 Samples from Lapinjärvi were taken directly to the University of Helsinki
 and placed into cold storage at -18°C.
 Samples from Rovaniemi were placed in the -40°C freezer at the METLA Rovaniemi
 field station, and then shipped under temperature control to the University
 of Helsinki.
 Upon arrival, the samples from Rovaniemi were placed in -18°C storage until
 further processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Measurements of Lesions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before lesion measurements and analysis, the samples were processed.
 First, bark tissue surrounding the inoculation point on any given sample
 was removed utilizing a hatchet, knife, scalpel, or other suitable tools.
 Care was taken not to damage phloem tissues underneath.
 In general, at least 10 cm of bark was cleared both above and below the
 inoculation point, with additional areas cleared if the lesion extended
 beyond the original margins of removed bark on the phloem.
 To the left or right of the inoculation point, 5 cm of bark was removed.
 Once bark was removed, the initial wounding and lesion was photographed
 and measured in the exposed phloem tissue.
 A total of five measurements were taken for each lesion: length of lesion
 extending upwards (towards the crown in stem samples, or towards the root
 collar in root samples) from the uppermost part of the wooden inoculation
 dowel, length of lesion extending downward from the lowermost point of
 the inoculation, length of lesion extension to the left and right of the
 inoculation point, and a total length measurement taken from the uppermost
 point of lesion extension upwards to the lowermost point of lesion extension
 downwards.
 After measurements of the phloem sample, phloem tissue was removed utilizing
 a mallet, scalpel, and woodworking chisels to expose the xylem tissue.
 Lesions present in the xylem tissue were photographed and measured in the
 same manner as the phloem tissue.

Analysis of Data
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preprocessing of the data was necessary to properly format the data, and
 to ensure that the data was suitable for subsequent statistical analysis.
 For the purposes of the analysis of the size of visible lesions, i.e, the
 total length of the lesion and total width of the lesion are used as the
 primary response variables.
 To create a single response variable with which to characterize the lesions
 of the individual tree, the lesions are conceptualized as 2-dimensional
 rectangles based on the total length and maximal width of the lesion as
 measured from the center of the inoculation point .
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$

 Summary statistics and general overview of the data is available in the
 results section.
 Welch's two sample t-test was used to determine if differences existed
 between the different directions of lesion growth..
 A linear mixed model was used to determine the effects that the categorical
 variables of site, tree, organ, and tissue had on tree response to the
 treatment.
 As repeated measurements from a single subject (i.e, tree) cannot be assumed
 to be independent of one another, explicit nesting was specified in building
 the model to ensure accurate interpretation of the model results.
 Linear mixed effects models allow for the broad analysis of data which
 takes on complex, interrelated levels.

 Exploratory analysis utilizing histograms and other charting techniques
 was utilized to explore the structure and nature of the data along all
 steps of modeling.
 A discussion of potential outliers as well as the effects they have on
 the outcome of the model is given in the appendix; because it was not possible
 to address the causes for several outliers present in the data, the data
 was left intact for the primary analysis.

, a Q-Q plot was created (see Figure X.x in appendix), and when data visually
 violated assumptions of normality, a log natural transform was used to
 attempt to bring the data into conformation of the normal distribution,
 and a subsequent histogram was utilized to verify the changes in the response
 variable.
 In elementary statistics comparing the sizes of lesion measurements, a
 constant of 1.0 was added to all measurements to correct in rare instances
 where no visible lesion growth presented in one of the directions measured.

Figure 1 is a boxplot of the the geometric response variable across sites
 and treatments.Variability between trees which were infected appears greater
 than control trees.
 Control trees appear to have lower general variation in lesion sizes.

Model Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The response variable for the model is the 
\begin_inset Formula $log_{e}$
\end_inset

 transformed product of the total length of the lesion and total width of
 the lesion (see equation 1).
 Main (fixed) effects for the model structure are the effect of treatment
 (control or infected), site (Rovaniemi or Lapinjärvi), organ (stem or root),
 and tissue (phloem or xylem).
 Additionally, all two way interactions between main effects were included.
 Random effects included in the model were accounted for in three separate
 grouping variables; tree level groupings, organ within tree level groupings,
 and sample within organ within tree level groupings.

\begin_layout Standard
Summary of the parameter estimates, confidence intervals for parameter estimates
 (95%), standard error of the samples parameter estimates, and 
\emph on

-values for the parameter estimates are given in Table 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intercept, i.e.
 the grand mean for all trees is the largest contribution on lesion sizes,
 and is statistically significant (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=23113.25, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.001).
 Lesion sizes did not vary significantly between the two field sites (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=0.14, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.71), nor did the size of lesions vary between root and stem organs (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=0.47, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.49).
 However, lesions did vary between xylem and phloem tissues (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=353.35, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.001), with xylem tissues having less total necrosis than phloem tissues.
 No difference in lesion sizes occurred in the interaction between treatment
 and site.
 However, the interaction between treatment and organ varied significantly
 (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=12.95, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.001), with stems which were wounded (mock inoculated) expressing smaller
 lesions sizes.
 The interaction between treatment and tissue did not vary significantly
 (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=0.61,
\emph on
 P
\emph default
=0.47).
 The interaction between site and organ varied marginally with Rovaniemi
 stems expressing larger lesion sizes (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=5.99, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.02).
 The response of tissues between sites varied significantly (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=33.52, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.0001), with xylem tissues in Rovaniemi expressing larger lesions .
 Lastly, the interaction between organs and tissues was significant 
\emph on
(F
\emph default
=6.96, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.009), indicating that stem xylem tissues expressed smaller lesion sizes.

Based on the results, this study concludes that differences in lesion sizes
 are not likely to be due to differences between the sites.
 However, readers would do well to note that many aspects of this study

 historical isolation from pathogen as a potential factor for differences

The study found no evidence for the effect of organ on the response in lesion

 However, other studies, including

\emph on
,
\emph default
 have concluded that a difference in the response of 
\emph on

\emph default
between roots and stems exists.
 Reasons for a lack of this finding in the study could be attributed to
 many possible factors, including soil type, temperature and climate, time
 between inoculation to harvest, relative ability of the fungal strain to
 overcome host responses.
 However, as the natural pathway for infection of 
\emph on
H.
 annosum s.l.

\emph default
 is through the roots, it is somewhat surprising that a difference is not
 present.
 One possible explanation for this observation is due to the sizes of roots
 inoculated.
 In Rovaniemi, the sizes of roots utilized for the inoculations was significantl
y smaller than the average root sizes in Lapinjärvi; a study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 Refitting the model using only data from the Lapinjärvi or Rovaniemi field
 sites does change the significance of the organ variable; in Lapinjärvi
 the variable is a significant predictor, whereas in Rovaniemi it is not,
 indicating that perhaps the smaller sizes of roots in Rovaniemi are the
 reason for a lack of significance of the organ variable in the model utilizing
 both field sites (See Appendix for secondary models)

 Because of this, it can be difficult to judge whether or not a difference

 based on the results of a few studies that have explored root inoculations.
 Further complications occur due to the highly variable root structure and
 variability in root sizes utilized for inoculation points in this and other
 studies, as well as the lack of control for genotype in this study.

 Further reasons for the observed difference in the response between differing

The interaction between treatment and organ was significant, with stems
 being less susceptible to wounding than roots.
 This is in contrast to other studies which have examined the response of
 organs to inoculation, which have found significant differences in the
 treatment by organ, e.g.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

, which found stem lesions more susceptible to wounding than root lesions.
 Furthermore, the interaction between site and organ was found to be marginally
 significant, with stems lesions in Rovaniemi being larger.
 This could be due to a number of
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

factors which were unaccounted for in this study.
 Norway spruce has high genetic plasticity, which could potentially account
 for differences in the response of the organs at various sites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Chen2012,Reich1996"

\end_inset

.
 However, the design of the study did not control for genotype of phenotype
 diversity, so there is no way to account for this variance in the study
 as it was executed.
 Other possible reasons why a different response by organ was different
 by site could be due to differences in the overall size of the trees, as
 trees of differing sizes and ages may respond differently to infections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Experimental Design Limitations
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The largest limitation in the study is the lack of clonal material.
 Although the results of the study may be sufficient for drawing broad-based
 conclusions about aspects of the defense response of Norway spruce to infection
s with 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum
\emph default
 in natural settings, it is not possible to conclude what aspects of an
 individual in the study contributed to more or less susceptibility.
 Clonal material would have allowed a better assessment of the influence
 and variability of individual tree's phenotypes.
 For example, if a tree on whole shows a strong resistance or susceptibility
 to the infections, with non clonal material we cannot infer if this is
 the result of the trees phenotype, or whether it would be expected to see
 this variation naturally in a sufficiently large sample of clonal material.
 This lack of clonal material is a principal reason why trees in this study
 are treated as random effects as opposed to fixed effects; in a study controlle
d for tree genotype with sufficient numbers of ramets per clones it would
 be possible to draw stronger conclusions about the resistance of individual
 Norway spruce genotypes to 
\emph on
H.
 parviporum 
\emph default
.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of control over genetics makes it difficult to know what to do
 with outliers present in the data; for this reason, several outliers in
 the traditional sense were kept in the analysis.
 Trees RT2 and LT8 showed extreme resistance and susceptibility to treatment,
 respectively.
 Tree LW8 had decay due to a natural fungal infection
\emph on
 
\emph default
prior to the experiment, but it was only noted when the tree was cut down
 for processing - another caveat of not having control over environmental
 factors or clonal material with which to work with.
 If clonal material was utilized, it would be possible to determine if the
 tree genotype was really susceptible, or if this was an unnatural response
 to the treatment.
 Tree RT2 was abnormally resistant to infection, but again it is not possible
 to deduce the reasons as to why.
 Because it is not possible to deduce the causes for responses of trees
 such as RT2 and LW8, which display extreme responses with this studies
 experimental design, it may not be appropriate to remove the suspected
 outliers from the analysis; for this reason, these trees and all samples
 from them were kept in the analysis.
 
\begin_inset Note Note

\begin_layout Plain Layout
However, as it is suspected that these two are outliers, it is possible
 to determine if their inclusion in the current model has any significant
 effects on the estimates of the parameter by removing the observations
 and refitting the model without them.
 This is done in the appendix.

\begin_layout Standard
The potential effects of historical isolation from the pathogen based on
 latitude could not accurately be determined based on this study's experimental
 design.
 Too many confounding factors could account for any potential observed differenc
es, even though this study found no difference between tree response between
 sites.
 Additionally, only one site in each geographical region was utilized for
 the study; to effectively determine the effects of a site factor, more
 than one replicate for each area (i.e, area where 
\emph on
H.
 annosum s.l..
 
\emph default
are known to naturally infect trees, versus one where 
\emph on
H.
 annosum s.l.
 
\emph default
are not known to be present) is necessary.
 However, a previous study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Karlsson2008"

\end_inset

 indicated that differences in resistance do exist between geographic areas;
 two sites in southern Europe utilizing clonal material (Greece and Italy)
 had significant correlations between fungal growth, lesion size and other
 indicators of resistance, while a third field site in Sweden utilizing
 the same clonal material did not share significant correlations with the
 southern European field sites.
 However, the authors speculated that environmental factors, not historical
 isolation of the host from the pathogen could be responsible for the lack
 of correlations between the two regions.
 Further studies could attempt to address differences between trees acclimatized
 to certain growing environments by using a crossed design wherein trees
 from both genetic origins are utilized across field sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Further issues with the experimental design for this study include a lack
 of control of external factors such as different flora and fauna at the
 sites could have implications in the estimation of site based effects.
 This is one major complication with carrying out field based experiments
 as opposed to those which take place in highly controlled laboratory and
 greenhouse settings.
 Temperature, weather events, and other potential natural influences are
 not generally controllable in field experiments.
 However, if we are interested in drawing ecological conclusions regarding
 the interactions between Norway spruce and 
\emph on
H.
 annosum s.l., 
\emph default
it is useful to carry out field experiments; any resulting residual variances
 can then be attributed to uncontrollable environmental factors, but would
 require that the experimental design properly controlled for both the host
 genotype and site factor.

 In this study, the choices taken in regards to the methodology utilized
 for analyzing and presenting data were based on balancing several conflicting
 goals: how to best characterize the lesion response on various levels while
 avoiding over parametrization of the model and maintaining interpretability.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, the response of interest is the lesion size as in indication
 of resistance or susceptibility for a given sample, with inferences then
 drawn for the different tissues, organs, and individual tree.
 In reality, the lesion presents as a three dimensional reaction to the
 inoculation.
 However, to analyze the lesions, a simplified view of the lesions was utilized,
 conceptualizing the lesions as a rectangular area based on maximal width
 and length measurements across the point of inoculation.
 Lesions from the inoculations presented in many ways, and no single geometric
 shape is consistent across lesions.
 In hindsight, there are better, albeit much more time consuming ways, to
 measure the lesions.
 With proper photographic equipment and software, it would be possible to
 measure accurately the entire area of the lesion without needing to resort
 to constricting the conceptualization of the lesion to a single shape,
 utilizing a known measurement (i.e., measuring the samples on a white background
 with a ruler / scale) as a calibration.
 Implementing this could increase the accuracy of the parameter estimates,
 as well as better characterize the actual lesions by calculating a highly
 accurate area measurement.
 This technique has been applied in other studies with agricultural plants,
 but to the best of the author's knowledge, has not been implemented in
 studies examining lesions created from

Outliers are of special concern, as their presence in data can modify parameter
 estimates.
 In this study, outliers were still included in the analysis.
 Nevertheless, to ignore the possibility of the influence of several observation

 be difficult to generalize.
 Differences in experimental design include ways in which the inoculation
 is performed.
 Deep tissue wounding has been used in various studies, and is done by boring
 directly to the heartwood of a living tree to introduce to the pathogen
 directly to susceptible tissues, and was the technique utilized for this
 study

Although the analysis is relatively appropriate for the experiment and data
 collected in this study, and does an acceptable job characterizing the
 lesions as well as the variance present in the study which are under controllab
le factors (i.e., treatment, organ, and tissue), the mixed effects approach
 does little to interpret the potential resistance or susceptibility of
 the trees on a biological level beyond looking at overall lesion sizes.
 Furthermore, the lack of control for tree genotype is a troubling shortcoming
 in this study which prevents anything beyond generalization about tree
 resistance to be drawn from this data.
 In future studies, use of clonal material would be essential for comparing
 the resistance across treatments.
 Furthermore, molecular methods could be utilized to explore in depth measures
 of resistance.
 For example, analysis of RNA transcripts to determine up-regulated gene
 products such as chitinase, terpenes, and other PR-family proteins, etc.,
 in resistant versus susceptible trees.
 The use of molecular methods in conjunction with with analysis of lesions
 would provide more detailed information about not only the resistance of
 trees characterized as a molecular response, but would also allow for correlati
ons to be made between specific gene products and lesion characteristics.

 This study did not analyze the actual growth of the fungus in relation
 to the size of the lesion response, which could be done in further work
 as an additional way to attempt to characterize the resistance levels of
 individual trees to infection.

 is a devastating forest pathogen which causes millions of euros in losses
 to timber products annually.
 Many factors contribute to the capability of the pathogen to proliferate
 and spread under natural conditions, and, despite research into forest
 tree breeding for resistance and use of various control methods, the pathogen
 still causes huge damages economically and continues to be a leading concern
 in the modern forestry sector.
 Understanding the different aspects of the epidemiology and life cycles
 of both the host and pathogen may hold key information to combating infections
 and breeding for improvements in resistance.
 Factors such as genetic origin, tree age and size, as well as environmental
 conditions all impact the resistance of Norway spruce to infection to

in natural conditions.
 Primary factors examined as the research for this project were the effects
 of site across areas where the pathogen is both known to be present as
 well as an area where the pathogen does not have a recent historical presence.
 Additional factors examined in this research include the potential for
 difference responses in both host tree organ (root and stem), tissues (phloem
 and xylem), as well as the statistical interactions between various crossed
 factors included in the design of the experiment.

\begin_layout Standard
The study found that overall, Norway spruce resistance does not appear to
 differ based on field site, and in this regard, the study concludes that
 resistance does not appear to vary in Norway spruce populations which are
 not known to have high rates of natural infection versus area in which
 the pathogen has a recent historical presence.
 Future studies should incorporate stricter controls, i.e., the use of clonal
 materials, and if possible, crossing of geographic origin of the clonal
 material across environmentally distinct field sites in attempt to better
 address the influence of geographic isolation from the pathogen in recent
 history.
 Further research into site based differences should also account for different
 environmental and soil based conditions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study did not find differences with regards to resistance based on the
 whether the inoculation was performed in the stem versus the root organ
 of a given tree.
 This is in contrast to other studies reviewed, which did find a difference
 between root and stems in their susceptibility.
 Future studies conducted in a similar matter should incorporate root size
 measurements as a potential influential variable.

Finally, the use of a mixed effects model to analyze the complex nature
 of the data collected proved to be a useful tool to interpret the results,
 as well as to shed light onto the influences of accounting for random effects
 in the modeling.
 Few other studies reviewed have taken this approach to modeling lesion
 response of forest trees; further studies may attain valuable additional
 information by including random effects into their analysis and moving
 away from typical multiple regression / ANOVA based analysis which collected
 data may violate statistical assumptions for in these sorts of experiments.
