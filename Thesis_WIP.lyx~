\begin_layout Standard
Norway Spruce (

) is a commercially significant conifer with a ubiquitous distribution throughou
t most of Finland.
 Norway Spruce accounts for 34% of total forest products in Finland, which
 includes timber and other wood based forest products

.
 Because of it's significant impact on the Finnish economy, it is important
 to understand and to address issues which negatively affect the growth
 and production of Norway Spruce.
 The most devastating pathogen affecting the growth of Norway Spruce is
 butt rot caused by the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

; as such, it is important to study the pathogen and host to better understand
 the complex nature of infection biology and resistance factors which hold
 the potential for mitigating losses and improving forest yields in areas
 where

 are prevalent.

Somewhat ironically, most recently established populations of Norway Spruce
 has only been in Norway for around 1,000 years, versus 6,500 in Finland,
 and 2,500 in Sweden.

 However, in this relatively short period of time (considering that

Although Norway Spruce in it's most recent introduction to Northern Europe
 occurred fairly recently, the last ice age in Europe circa 18,500 years
 ago likely wiped out peviously established populations of 
\emph on

in northern Europe.
 Evidence suggests that ice free areas in Western Scandanavia may have had
 Spruce and Pine surviving throughout the most recent ice age, but populations
 of Norway Spruce in most of Scandanavia are descended from the more recent
 westward migration of Norway Spruce

 Northern Europe.
 In Finland, Norway Spruce is found throughout most of the country.
 Only small areas in the very northern parts of Finland in the Arctic Circle
 are devoid of

 is a pathogenic basidiomycete species complex which has the ability to
 infect a broad range of coniferous trees.
 A necrotroph, 
\emph on

\emph default
s.l.
 causes damage by selectively degrading lignin and cellulose in host trees;
 no cures are available after infection has been established within a host,
 and death of the host tree will occur eventually, although the degradation
 of host tissues to the point of lethality may take several decades.
 Due to the mortal nature of infections by

\emph default
knowledge of the life-cycle and infection biology of the pathogen is critical
 to understanding how best to deal with the pathogen in areas where

The

species complex is comprised of several inter-sterile groups of species
 with differing host preferences.
 In Europe, three distinct mating types are recognized :

\emph default
sensu stricto, 
\emph on
Heterobasidion parviporum
\emph default
, and

 Despite a preference for specific hosts, several species within the

 spreads via a variety of methods.
 The primary source for new infections caused by 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
is through airborne dispersal of spores (FIND SOURCE AND INSERT).
 Basidiospores are the product of sexual reproduction in 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
and serve as the primary source of inoculations.
 In addition, conidiospores (which are a product of asexual reproduction)
 can also start new infections, but are not the primary source of new infections.
 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
cannot infect healthy, undamaged tree tissues; as such, most infections
 occur in trees which have been wounded on the surface, exposing either
 heartwood or sapwood tissues beneath the bark of the tree.
 In areas where conifers are intensively harvested and managed, mechanical
 damages due to forestry related activities provide new surfaces for inoculation
s, and exacerbate the problem of 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
infections, leading to high rates of infection and heavy losses (INSERT
 SOURCE).

\begin_layout Standard
Although 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
infect via surface wounds, in natural settings where wounding does not provide
 a suitable substrate for germination of 
\emph on
Heterobasidion 
\emph default
spores, infections can still occur in roots.
 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
do not have the ability to grow far in soil alone; they generally require
 host substrate to grow and proliferate (INSERT SOURCE).
 However, root systems of an infected tree which are sufficiently near to
 neighboring tree's root systems, or which are grafted, or otherwise in
 contact with the root systems of another tree can permit mycelium from
 the infected tree to pass into the healthy root systems of another tree
 (INSERT SOURCE).
