Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
Norway Spruce (
\begin_inset Flex Emph
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Picea abies

\end_inset

) is a commercially significant conifer with a ubiquitous distribution throughou
t most of Finland.
 Norway Spruce accounts for 34% of total forest products in Finland, which
 includes timber and other wood based forest products

.
 Because of it's significant impact on the Finnish economy, it is important
 to understand and to address issues which negativly affect the growth and
 production of Norway Spruce.
 The most devastating pathogen affecting the growth of Norway Spruce is
 butt rot caused by the

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

; as such, it is important to study the pathogen and host to better understand
 the complex nature of infection biology and resistance factors which hold
 the potential for mitigating losses and improving forest yeilds in areas
 where 
\emph on

 are prevalent.

Somewhat ironically, most recent populations of Norway Spruce has only been
 in Norway for around 1,000 years, versus 6,500 in Finland, and 2,500 in
 Sweden.

, established itself in Northern Europe via introgression through Eastern
 Finland approximatly 6,500 years ago

.
 However, in this relativly short period of time (considering that

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Although Norway Spruce in it's most recent introduction to Northern Europe
 occured fairly recently, the last ice age in Europe circa 18,500 years
 ago probably wiped out peviously established populations of 
\emph on
Picea abies 
\emph default
in northern Europe.
 Evidence suggests that ice free areas in Western Scandanavia may have had
 Spruce and Pine surviving throughout the most recent ice age, but populations
 of Norway Spruce in most of Scandanavia are descended from the more recent
 westward migration

), Norway Spruce has become one of the most dominant forest trees in of
 Northern Europe.
 In Finland, Norway Spruce is found throughtout most of the country.
 Only small areas in the very northern parts of Finland in the Arctic Circle
 are devoid of

Biology, Lifecycle and Infection of 
\emph on
Heterobasidion Annosum sensu latu
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Heterobasidion annosum S.L
\emph default
.
 is a pathogenic basidiomycete species complex which infects a broad range
 of conifer trees.
 A necrotroph, 
\emph on
Heterobasidion annosum 
\emph default
causes damage by selectivly degrading lignin and cellulosic tissues in host
 trees; no cures are available after infection has been established within
 a host, and death of the host tree will occur eventually, although the
 degredation of host tissues to the point of lethality may take several
 decades.
 Due to the mortal nature of infections by 
\emph on
Heterobasidion, 
\emph default
knowledge of the lifecycle and infection biology of the pathogen is critical
 to understanding how best to deal with the pathogen in areas where 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
present a problem.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 
\emph on
Heterobasidion 
\emph default
species complex is comrpised of several inter-sterile groups of species
 with differing host preferences.
 In Europe, three distinct mating types are recognized : 
\emph on
Heterobasidion annosum sensu stricto
\emph default
, 
\emph on
Heterobasidion parviporum
\emph default
, and 
\emph on
Heterobasidion abitenium, 
\emph default
with host preference for pines (
\emph on
Pinus
\emph default
), spruce (
\emph on
Picea spp.
\emph default
), and firs (
\emph on
Abies spp
\emph default
.), respectivly

.
 Despite a preference for specific hosts, species within the 
\emph on

 complex are able to infect other than their preferred hosts, albiet with
 less efficiency.
