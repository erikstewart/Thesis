Defense Systems and Resistance in Conifers 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Conifers have a variety of defense systems for dealing with abiotic and
 biotic threats.
 The major defense systems which conifers posses for dealing with pathogens
 are constitutive and inducible defenses.
 Structural or constitutive defenses include tissues, structures, and chemicals
 present in parts of the tree which either prevent or reduce the possibility
 or severity of infection by a pathogen.
 Induced defenses are initiated locally and/or systemically upon the recognition
 of a pathogen, and include a variety of possible defense actions including
 secondary metabolite production, priming of system wide defenses, and changes
 to physical structures of the tree.
 Genetic defenses represent gene level interactions between plant and pathogen,
 and can confer increased resistance to a pathogen or outright immunity,
 depending on the tree and pathogen.
 The constitutive and induced systems of defense present in conifers are
 not mutually exclusive of one another, and interact with components of
 the other systems of defense within the tree on some level.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Constituent and Inducible Defenses in Conifers
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Constituent defenses present throughout conifers include various types of
 tissues and structures which are produced during regular, unchallenged
 growth.
 Bark represents the outermost layer of defense in a conifer, and is comprised
 of several distinct tissues: periderm, cortex, phloem and cambial tissues.
 The periderm is highly suberized and hydrophobic which helps to inhibit
 adhesion and germination of fungal spores
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 In most cases, it is not possible for a fungal pathogen to actively infiltrate
 intact outer bark tissues, a notable exception being some species of fungi

\emph default
which can penetrate outer defenses 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

In addition to the compartmentalization of tissues surrounding a wound or

Upon infection with Heterobasidion annosum, broad changes occur in both
 the host and pathogen.
 Specific elicitors detected by a susceptible host can initiate changes
 to the physiology of the host both locally and systemically.
 Changes on the host include increased production of secondary metabolites
 in response to the pathogen.
 Similarly, once the pathogen begins to encounter resistance, it will produce
 compounds which assist in overcoming tree defenses.

Two sites were utilized in this study, one in northern Finland (Rovaniemi)
 where presence of Heterobasidion parviporum was not known to occur naturally
 in Norway Spruce stands, and a site in Southern Finland in Lapinjarvi,
 where extensive presence of the pathogen has been noted historically.
 Both sites were selected in Metla administered areas.
 In Rovaniemi, the site was comprised of planted trees with an age of around
 70 years, from natural, non clonal stock representative of the natural
 local populations of Norway Spruce.
 In Lapinjarvi, the site was comprised of naturally regenerated trees (non-plant
ed), with estimates of age ranging from 30-60 years old.
 Soils in the northern site were rockier, versus softer soils in the southern
 field site.

 The isolate was maintained on 2% Malt extract agar and kept at 4º Celsius.
 To create a delivery vessel for the inoculum, wooden dowels of Norway Spruce
 measuring roughly 6 mm diameter by 7 mm length were created utilizing a
 drill press and a jewelers saw.
 Cut and formed dowels were autoclaved for thirty minutes with roughly 100
 milliliters of Milli-Q water.
 Subsequently, autoclaved dowels for control trees were placed onto previously
 prepared 2% malt extract agar plates, and incubated at room temperature
 for two weeks.

Preparation of Study Trees and Inoculation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Inoculations in Lapinjarvi were carried out the 14th of June.
 In Rovaniemi, inoculations were carried out on the 26th of June, 2013.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For this study, each tree was treated with a total of six inoculations;
 three stem inoculations placed at 50 cm, 100 cm, and 150 cm above the soil
 level, and three in the roots placed opportunistically depending on the
 size and shape of the exposed root(s).
 Whenever possible the inoculations were placed on the parts of the root
 facing upwards towards the crown of the tree.
 A minimum of 25cm upwards or downwards was maintained whenever possible
 between root inoculations in instances where a single large root was inoculated
 more than once.
 In all trees, the inoculations were performed such that the inoculation
 point of the stem inoculations was at the same direction to minimize any
 possible variance due to azimuth.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Prior to applying treatment (i.e, insertion of wounding control dowels or
 
\emph on
Heterobasidion parviporum 
\emph default
colonized dowels), roots of the study trees were dug up carefully using
 garden spades, and then outer surfaces of exposed roots were cleaned of
 excess dirt and debris utilizing a large brush with synthetic fiber hairs.
 Directly before inoculating the trees, the area where the inoculation were
 to be placed was sprayed with 70% ethanol to minimize the possibility of
 introducing localized contaminants into the xylem or phloem of the tree.
 All tools utilized in the inoculation process which had direct contact
 with either the host tree, or wooden inoculation dowels (and thus, potentially
 
\emph on
Heterobasidion parviporum
\emph default
) were sprayed with 70% ethanol and wiped clean prior to each use.
 Tools used for inoculations included: stainless steel forceps, for handling
 of the wooden dowel and removing any excess origional host tissues, 7mm
 interior diameter stainless steel punch for creating the bore and removing
 host tissue, and a large rubber headed mallet, utilized for hammering in
 the punch.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each stem inoculation, a steel punch with a diameter of 7 mm was used
 to bore through the bark of the tree to the inoculation point.
 Living host tissue from the cavity created by the bore was removed, and
 then inspected to ensure that the depth of the hole bored reached into
 the xylem of the host tree.
 Confirmation of sufficient depth was done by expecting the tissue removed
 from the bore; a clear delineation exists between phloem and xylem tissues.
 Immediately after confirmation of adequate bore depth, a wooden dowel for
 the specific treatment for the tree was introduced into the hole and secured
 into host tissue via use of forceps and the back end of the bore utilized
 to remove outer bark and phloem tissues.
 Immediately after the dowel was secured into the host tissues, the area
 of the inoculation was wrapped with parafilm to minimize the chance of
 post-inoculation contamination.
 After trees were inoculated and inoculation points were wrapped with parafilm,
 the roots were re-buried with the loose soil removed to expose the roots
 for inoculations.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Harvest and Processing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Trees were cut down roughly three months after initial inoculations.
 Roots of the respective trees were re-dug carefully and extracted.
 Primary tools utilized in harvest were chainsaws.
 Due to the large size of the trees, only the lower segment of the stem
 containing the inoculation points (and 50cm above/below the upper and lower
 inoculation point) were removed.
 In root samples, as much as was feasible and reasonable, up to 50 cm above
 and below the inoculation point was collected for each inoculation.
 Samples were labeled with the site (L, R, for Lapinjarvi or Rovaniemi),
 treatment(W, for wounding control, T, for treatment), tree (1-15), and
 replicate number, (A,B,C for stem representing 50, 100, and 150cm inoculation
 points, and R1, R2, R3 for root inoculations, with R1 being the closest
 inoculation point to the root collar) before storing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
All samples were placed into large black trash bags (Lapinjarvi) or Kevlar
 sacks (Rovaniemi) once trimmed to size at the respective field site.
 Samples from Lapinjarvi were taken directly to the University of Helsinki
 and placed into cold storage at -18°C.
 Samples from Rovaniemi were placed in the -40°C freezer at the METLA Rovaniemi
 field station, and then shipped under temperature control to the University
 of Helsinki.
 Upon arrival, the samples from Rovaniemi were placed in -18°C storage until
 further processing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Measurements of Lesions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The samples required a significant amount of work to process for measurement
 and analysis.
 First, bark tissue surrounding the inoculation point on any given sample
 was removed utilizing a hatchet, knife, scalpel, or other suitable tools.
 Care was taken not to damage phloem tissues underneath.
 In general, at least 10 cm of bark was cleared both above and below the
 inoculation point.
 To the left or right of the inoculation point, 5 cm of bark was removed.
 Once bark was removed, the initial wounding and lesion was photographed
 and measured in the exposed phloem tissue; if the lesion extended beyond
 the area of removed bark, the rest of the lesion was uncovered.
 A total of five measurements were taken for each lesion: length of lesion
 extending upwards (towards the crown in stem samples, or towards the root
 collar in root samples) from the uppermost part of the wooden inoculation
 dowel, length of lesion extending downward from the lowermost point of
 the inoculation, length of lesion extension to the left and right of the
 inoculation point, and a total length measurement taken from the uppermost
 point of lesion extension upwards to the lowermost point of lesion extension
 downwards.
 After measurements of the phloem sample, phloem tissue was removed utilizing
 a mallet, scalpel, and woodworking chisels to expose the xylem tissue.
 Lesions present in the xylem tissue were photographed and measured in the
 same manner as the phloem tissue.

Preprocessing of the data was necessary to properly format the data, and
 to ensure that the data was suitable for subsequent statistical analysis.
 For the purposes of the analysis of the size of visible lesions, i.e, the
 total length of the lesion and total width of the lesion are used as the
 primary response variables.
 To create a single response variable with which to characterize the lesions
 of the individual tree, the lesions are conceptualized as a 2-dimensional

No depth measurements were taken on samples to determine the progression
 of the lesion into the tree from the inoculation point.
 Because the depth of the initial bore was not controlled for in the experiment,
 and because the thickness of phloem proceeding xylem varies across trees
 and samples within the tree, it did not make sense to incorporate depth
 as a measurement in this experiment.

 Summary statistics and general overview of the data is available in the

 A linear mixed model was used to determine the effects that the categorical
 variables of site, tree, organ, and tissue had on tree response to the
 treatment.
 As repeated measurements from a single subject (i.e, tree) cannot be assumed
 to be independent of one another, explicit nesting was specified in building
 the model to ensure accurate interpretation of the model results.Linear
 mixed effects models allow for the broad analysis of data which takes on
 complex, interrelated levels.
 Several models were created, ranging from basic to more complex models
 with interactions; an explanation regarding the comparison of different
 models, and reasons for final model selection as presented in the results

Model Structure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The response variable for the model is the 
\begin_inset Formula $log_{e}$
\end_inset

 transformed product of the total length of the lesion and total width of
 the lesion (see equation 1).
 Main (fixed) effects for the model structure are the effect of treatment
 (control or infected), site (rovaniemi or lapinjarvi), organ (stem or root),
 and tissue (phloem or xylem).
 Additionally, all two way interactions between main effects were included.
 Random effects included in the model were accounted for in three separate
 grouping variables; tree level groupings, organ within tree level groupings,
 and sample within organ within tree level groupings.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Fixed Effects
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Summary of the parameter estimates, confidence intervals for parameter estimates
 (95%), standard error of the samples parameter estimates, and 
\emph on

\emph default
-values for the parameter estimates are given in Table 3.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intercept for lesion sizes irrespective of treatments, organs, tissues,
 etc., for all trees from the log transformed response variable is the largest
 contribution of the fixed effect on lesion size, and is statistically significa
nt (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=23113.25, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.0001).
 Mean lesions sizes as characterized by the geometric response did not vary
 significantly between the two field sites (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=0.14, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.71), nor did the mean lesion geometric response vary between root and
 stem organs (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=0.47, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.49).
 However, geometric lesion response did vary between xylem and phloem tissues
 (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=353.35, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.0001), with xylem tissues having less total necrosis than phloem tissues.
 No difference in geometric lesion response occurred in the interaction
 between treatment and site.
 However, the interaction between treatment and organ varied significantly
 (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=12.95, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.0007), but an interaction between treatment and tissue did not (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=0.61,
\emph on
 P
\emph default
=0.47).
 The interaction between site and organ varied marginally according to site
 (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=5.99, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.02), but the response of tissues between sites varied significantly (
\emph on
F
\emph default
=33.52, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=<0.0001).
 Lastly, the interaction between organs and tissues was significant 
\emph on
(F
\emph default
=6.96, 
\emph on
P
\emph default
=0.009).

 Reviewing the ranges and densities of the profile plots gives an indication
 of the likelihood of the parameter estimate being equal to a given value

 Parameter profiles are normally distributed, with some kurtosis evident

 tree, organ within tree, and sample within organ within tree groupings
 (

 Other profiles of parameter likelihood (i.e, those representing fixed effects)

 The range of the profiled parameters strongly coincide with the 95% confidence

\begin_layout Standard
The effect of site studied in this model was not a significant influence
 upon lesion size, and in this regard, the study concludes that differences
 in lesion sizes are not likely to be due to influences of latitude.
 However, readers would do well to note that many aspects of this study
 are subject to analysis only in the context of the collected data and experimen
t performed, and thus broad based inferences upon the effects of latitude
 as a potential factor for differences in lesion response in

 However, their study explored the ability of 
\emph on

\emph default
 to colonize in different geographical locations versus 
\emph on

\emph default
, but did not look at regions where the fungus was not known to be present
 prior to the study.
 Nevertheless, they loosely concluded that difference in geographic origin
 might not affect overall spruce resistance.
 A study by 
\emph on

 similarly concluded that differences between sites in overall resistance
 of 
\emph on
Picea abies

 to Heterobasidion parviporum is negligible, although their specific research
 looked at differences between different soil types, and did not investigate
 the potential effect of latitude.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The study found no evidence for the effect of organ on the response in lesion
 size.
 However, other studies, including 
\emph on

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Kerio2014"

\end_inset

,
\emph default
 have concluded that a difference in the response of 
\emph on
Picea abies 
\emph default
between roots and stems exists.
 Reasons for a lack of this finding in the study could be attributed to
 many possible factors, including soil type, temperature and climate, time
 between inoculation to harvest, relative ability of the fungal strain to
 overcome host responses, etc.
 However, as the natural pathway for infection of Heterobasidion is through
 the roots, it is somewhat surprising that a difference is not present.
 One possible explanation for this observation is due to the sizes of roots
 inoculated.
 In Rovaniemi, the sizes of roots utilized for the inoculations was significantl
y smaller than the average (no measurements were taken, however, as a whole,
 it was visually evident that these roots as a whole were significantly
 smaller on average than those in the Lapinjarvi field site); a study by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "Garbelotto1997"

\end_inset

 found a positive correlation between root diameter and fungal growth.
 It is worth noting that most studies where artificial inoculations have
 been performed on 
\emph on
Picea abies 
\emph default
with 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
focused solely on stem inoculations, which does not mimic the natural infection
 pathway in 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Because of this, it can be difficult to judge whether or not a difference
 is generally assumed to exist between the response between the two organs
 based on the results of a few studies that have explored root inoculations.
 Further complications occur due to the highly variable root structure and
 sizes utilized for inoculation points in this and other studies, as well
 as the lack of control for genotype present in this study.

 Other studies reviewed have primarily focused on one tissue, or have not

 For example, the sapwood tissues in Norway spruce which are more resistant

 contribute to differences in resistance levels of the phloem in individual
 trees depending on the resistance of a given phenotype

Several of the interactions in this study were found to be significant influence

\emph on

\emph default
The interaction between treatment and organ was significant, with stems
 being less susceptible to wounding than roots.
 This is in contrast to other studies which have examined the response of
 organs to inoculation, which have found significant differences in the
 treatment by organ.
 Furthermore, the interaction between site and organ was found to be marginally
 significant.
 This could be due to a number of factors.
 Norway spruce has high genetic plasticity, which could potentially account
 for differences in the response of the organs at various sites 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "Chen2012,Reich1996"

\end_inset

.
 However, the design of the study did not control for genotype of phenotype
 diversity, so there is no way to account for this variance within the model.
 Other possible reasons why a different response by organ was different
 by site could be due to differences in the overall size of the trees

 to improve in future studies.

\begin_layout Standard
First, the largest limitation in the study is the lack of clonal material.
 Although the results of the study may be sufficient for drawing broad-based
 conclusions about aspects of the defense response of Norway spruce to infection
s with 
\emph on
Heterobasidion parviporum
\emph default
, it is not possible to conclude what aspects of an individual in the study
 contributed to more or less susceptibility.
 Clonal material would have allowed a better assessment of the influence
 and variability of individual tree's phenotypes.
 For example, if a tree on whole shows a strong resistance or susceptibility
 to the infections, we cannot infer if this is the result of the trees phenotype
, or whether it would expected to see this variation naturally in a sufficiently
 large sample of clones.
 This lack of clonal material is a principal reason why trees in this study
 are treated as random effects as opposed to fixed effects; in a study which
 controlled for tree genotype with sufficient numbers of ramets per clones
 it would be possible to draw stronger conclusions about the resistance
 of individual Norway spruce to 
\emph on
Heterobasidion 
\emph default
species.

\begin_layout Standard
The lack of control over genetics makes it difficult to know what to do
 with outliers present in the data; for this reason, several outliers in
 the traditional sense were kept in the analysis.
 Trees RT2 and LT8 showed extreme resistance and susceptibility to treatment,
 respectively.
 Tree LW8 was naturally infected with 
\emph on
Heterobasidion annosum 
\emph default
prior to the experiment, but it was only noted when the tree was cut down
 for processing - another caveat of not having control over environmental
 factors or clonal material with which to work with.
 If clonal material was utilized, it would be possible to determine if the
 tree gemtype was really susceptible, or if this was an unnatural response
 to the treatment.
 Tree RT2 was abnormally resistant to infection, but again it is not possible
 to deduce the reasons as to why

.
 Because it is not possible to deduce the causes for responses of trees
 such as RT2 and LW8, which display extreme responses with this studies
 experimental design, it may not be appropriate to remove the suspected
 outlier from the analysis; for this reason, these trees and all samples
 from them were kept in the analysis.
 However, as it is suspected that these two are outliers, it is possible
 to determine if their inclusion in the current model has any significant
 effects on the estimates of the parameter by removing the observations
 and refitting the model without them.
 This is done in the appendix.

\begin_layout Standard
Essentially, the effects of latitude could not accurately be determined
 based on this study's experimental design.
 Too many confounding factors could account for any potential observed differenc
es, even though this study found no difference between tree response between
 sites.
 Additionally, only one site in each geographical region was utilized for
 the study; to effectively determine the effects of a site factor, more
 than on replicate for each area (i.e, area where 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
are known to naturally infect trees, versus one where 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp.
 
\emph default
are not known to be present) is necessary.
 However, a previous study by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Karlsson2008"

\end_inset

 indicated that difference do exist between geographic areas; two sites
 in southern Europe utilizing clonal material (Greece and Italy) had significant
 correlations between fungal growth, lesion size and other indicators of
 resistance, while a third field site in Sweden utilizing the same clonal
 material did share significant correlations with the southern European
 sites.
 However, the authors speculated that environmental factors, not historical
 isolation of the host from the pathogen could be responsible for the lack
 of correlations between the two regions.

\begin_layout Standard
Further issues with the experimental design for this study include a lack
 of control of external factors such as different flora and fauna at the
 sites could have implications in the estimation of site based effects.
 This is one major complication with carrying out field based experiments
 as opposed to those which take place in highly controlled laboratory and
 greenhouse settings.
 Temperature, weather events, and other potential natural influences are
 not controllable in field experiments.
 However, if we are interested in drawing ecological conclusions regarding
 the interactions between Norway spruce and 
\emph on
Heterobasidion spp., 
\emph default
it may be useful to carry out field experiments; any resulting residual
 variances could then be attributed to uncontrollable environmental factors,
 but would require that the experimental design properly controlled for
 both the host genotype and site factors, which this study did not do.

Potential issues in the Analysis
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Data analysis, in many instances, becomes a subjective task as opposed to
 a purely objective one.
 In this study, the choices taken in regards to the methodology utilized
 for analyzing and presenting data were based on balancing several conflicting
 goals.
 Parsimony, or the practical implementation of the principal of Occam's
 razor is something to strive for in any analysis.
 However, when considering different hypotheses in which to explain phenomena,
 achieving more parsimony without the loss of information can be difficult
 when there is no standard, or exact way in which to summarize and conceptualize
 the outcomes.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, the response of interest is the lesion size as in indication
 of resistance / susceptibility for a given sample, with inferences then
 drawn for the tissues, organs, and individual tree.
 In reality, the lesion presents as a three dimensional reaction to the
 inoculation.
 However, to analyze the lesions, a simplified view of the lesions was utilized,
 conceptualizing the lesions as a rectangular area based on maximal width
 and length measurements from the point of inoculation.
 Lesions present in many ways, and no single geometric shape is consistent
 across lesions.
 In hindsight, there are better, albeit much more time consuming ways, to
 measure the lesions.
 With proper photographic equipment and software, it would be possible to
 measure accurately the entire area of the lesion without needing to resort
 to constricting the conceptualization of the lesion to a single shape,
 utilizing a known measurement (i.e., measuring the samples on a white background
 with a ruler / scale) as a calibration.
 One potential issue in implementing this would increase the accuracy of
 the parameter estimates, as well as better characterize the actual lesions
 by calculating a highly accurate area measurement.
 This technique has been applied in other studies with agricultural plants,
 but to the best of the author's knowledge, has not been implemented in
 studies examining lesions created from

\begin_layout Standard
Outliers are of special concern, as their presence in data can modify parameter
 estimates.
 In this study, outliers were still included in the analysis, for reasons
 mentioned previously.
 Nevertheless, to ignore the possibility of the influence of several observation
s which might be traditionally be considered outliers would be remiss.
 A discussion of potential outliers as well as the effects they have on
 the outcome of the model is given in the appendix.

\begin_layout Subsection
Uncertainty in Results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the analysis is relatively appropriate for the experiment and data
 collected, and does an acceptable job characterizing the lesions as well
 as variance present in the study which are under controllable factors (i.e.,
 treatment, organ, and tissue), the mixed effects approach does little to
 interpret the potential resistance or susceptibility of the trees on a
 biological level.
 Furthermore, the lack of control for tree genotype is a troubling shortcoming
 in this study which prevents anything beyond generalization about tree
 resistance to be drawn from this data.
 In future studies, use of clonal material would be essential for comparing
 the resistance across treatments.
 Furthermore, molecular methods could be utilized to explore in depth measures
 of resistance.
 For example, analysis of RNA transcripts to determine up-regulated gene
 products such as chitinase, terpenes, and other PR-family proteins, etc.,
 in resistant versus susceptible trees.
 The use of molecular methods in conjunction with with analysis of lesions
 would provide more detailed information about not only the resistance of
 trees characterized as a molecular response, but would also allow for correlati
ons to be made between specific gene products and lesion characteristics.
 Previous studies have incorporated analysis of lesions / fungal growth
 within host tissues and molecular methods for assessing various aspects
 of tree resistance to

In hindsight, it is difficult to consider latitude as a reasonable effect
 to study for the resistance of Norway spruce to

; in reality, isolation from historical presence of the pathogen is the
 parameter this study attempted to address, and subsequent studies should
 look at this along with specific environmental factors.
